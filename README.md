# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction


ðŸ—½ðŸš• Performance of data analysis in taxi trips in NYC and creation of a Random Forest Regressor in order to predict the duration of taxi trips.
This project was part of the course "Data Mining Techniques", as taught in 2022 by professor [Dimitris Gunopulos](http://kddlab.di.uoa.gr/dg.html).


The project covers the following main topics:
- Data cleansing
- Data analysis on variables (number of passengers etc.) and visualization of the results
- Clustering (and finding the optimal number of clusters)
- Random Forest Regression
- GridSearchCV
- Map creation with pickup and dropoff points

This project is the result of a collaboration with [Giorgos Nikolaou](https://github.com/giorgosnikolaou).
